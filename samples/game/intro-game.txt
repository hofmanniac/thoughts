This is the beginning of the game. In 1-2 paragraphs, introduce the player to the overall campaign and quest goal. Do not give away the quest overview or objectives yet. Bring the player into the story through an epic-style introduction, describe the current scene, and then ask the play what they would like to do next. Always use the second person voice.
