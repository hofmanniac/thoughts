Then the second rule will enhance the information that when an entity refuses another entity a permit, then the first entity may fear violence, and the second entity may advocate violence. Of course this is not always true, but may be true and so the engine generates it as a possibility for later evaluation.\n",

There is no special signifigance of \"parse\" to the engine."
